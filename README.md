# React Boilerplate

This project is setup using Vite with React+TS configurations. It also contains the newest version of tailwindcss while providing some custom stylings for breakpoints, font sizes, line heights, colours, shadows, and some animations/transitions.

This project comes with react-router pre installed with a simple architecture setup for managing page routing which can be customized at `/routes/Routes.tsx` using the ProjectRoutes component.

This project also utilizes npmrc to enforce node version 22.18.0 if running the project using pnpm.

This project is set to run in `StrictMode` for development, feel free to remove from `src/main.tsx` if the double error pops are a nuisance.
